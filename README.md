### Abstract
This document contains the instructions for the project on classification for the
course Statistical Machine Learning, 1RT700. The problem is to classify the gender
of the two main actors (one male, one female) in Hollywood movies. The training
set consists of 1037 films and you will later be given a test set of 387 films. You are
expected to (i) try some (or all) classification methods from the course and evaluate
their performance on the problem, and (ii) make a decision which one to use and
‘put in production’ against a test set. Your final prediction will be evaluated and
also compared to the performances of the other student groups. You will also write
a report about the features that accurately predict who talks most in films. You will
document your project by writing a report, which will be reviewed anonymously
by your peers. A very well implemented and documented project will earn you a
‘gold star’ and a higher grade on the report.
